# GVE_DevNet_Webex_ChatBot_IT_Services
This is a sample Webex Chatbot showing how requesting IT services (Software, Hardware, Access, etc..) can be simplified and automated. Allowing the user to respond with button clicks, selecting from a list, filling a field, etc.. using Adaptive Cards.

## Solution Overview
This prototype is showing a sample Webex Chatbot that responds to messages by displaying list of options as: buttons, drop-down lists, fields to fill, etc.. The scenario for this speicific bot is following a general use case of opening a ticket requesting IT Services/support. 

This chatbot sample is running and can be tested by sending a message in Webex to:  
```IT-services@webex.bot```

A sample overview of the services to be requested is shown as follows:

So when a user initiates a message with this chatbot, the first response will be as follows:
![/IMAGES/Initial_msg.png](/IMAGES/Initial_msg.png)

- When the user selects "Submit a new request" button for example, the next card with its list of choices will be shown:  
![/IMAGES/New_request_ac.png](/IMAGES/New_request_ac.png)

- As the user selects the next choice (for example: Hardware request), the next customized card will be displayed, and so on:
![/IMAGES/New_request_hardware_ac.png](/IMAGES/New_request_hardware_ac.png)

- In the final prompt, the user will be asked to input the details needed, which also can be customized as well:  
![/IMAGES/Filling_info_sample.png](/IMAGES/Filling_info_sample.png)

- After the data is collected, the next action for the collected data can be customized as well. For example: sending it to the IT team via email, storing it in a file/db, opening a ticket through ticketing system's APIs, etc..

## Installation

This Webex Chatbot prototype has been developed and deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) following the instructions detailed here:
https://github.com/gve-sw/WebexBot_HerokuDeployment  
- Where [bot.py](/bot.py) file has been developed in this reposetory, with [cards](/cards) folder containing customized [adaptive card](https://adaptivecards.io/) as bot responses.  
- After the application is hosted on an accessible URL, two webhooks must be created by the bot's API key, using [Webex Webhooks APIs](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/webhooks/)
    1. To detect recieiving new "messages" (which are text messages)
        - By [creating a new webhook](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/webhooks/create-a-webhook) with:
            -   resource: ```messages```
            -   event: ```created```
            -   targetUrl: matching the application's URL, and the default endpoint ```/```
                - Can be changed inside [bot.py](/bot.py)
                ```python
                # Getting an initial message, triggering the webhook for: Messages:created
                @app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
                ```
    2. To detect recieiving new "attachmentActions" (which are adaptive cards messages)
        - By [creating a new webhook](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/webhooks/create-a-webhook) with:
            -   resource: ```attachmentActions```
            -   event: ```created```
            -   targetUrl: matching the application's URL, and the endpoint for receiving attachment actions ```/attachment_action``` 
                - Can be changed inside [bot.py](/bot.py)
                ```python
                # Getting an attachment action, triggering the webhook for: attachmentActions:created
                @app.route('/attachment_action', methods=['POST'])
                ```


## Configuration/Customization

To customize the chatbot's response messages, adaptive cards used, or actions taken, changes must be done in either:
- [bot.py](/bot.py):
    - To change what actions are taken when a new message has been recieved.  
    For example, to change the initial response to any text message, edit the lines of code inside ```initial_message_received``` function:
    ```python
    message = "Hi, I'm a Webex bot! I'm here to assist you with IT services.. ðŸ’»âš  "
    api.messages.create(roomId=w_room_id, markdown=message)
    send_card(w_room_id, '000_init_card.json')
    ```

- [cards](/cards) Folder:
    - To change how the adaptive cards look and what buttons/actions do they include.  
    For example, to customize what the initial adaptive card includes, edit [000_init_card.json](/cards/000_init_card.json) file:
    ```json
    ...
    "actions": [
        {
            "type": "Action.Submit",
            "title": "Submit a new request",
            "style": "positive",
            "data": {
                "action": "request"
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "Action.Submit",
            "title": "Report an issue",
            "style": "destructive",
            "data": {
                "action": "issue"
            }
        }
    ],
    ...
    ```
- Notice that each button/action of this adaptive card has a ```data``` element, which includes any inputs to be sent to the application's side (e.g: ```"action": "issue"```). This is to determine what has the user selected, and customize what the next action will be.
    - For example, handling the initial card buttons:  
    ```python
    # 00-Initial Card responses:
    if action == 'request':
        send_card(w_room_id, '010_request.json')
    elif action == 'issue':
        send_card(w_room_id, '020_issue.json')
    ```
